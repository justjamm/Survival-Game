# Survival Game

"Survival Game" is my final project for Professor Steven Brandt's CSC 1351 course.

The requirements for this project was that it;

1. Use the professor's [BasicGraphics](https://github.com/stevenrbrandt/BasicGraphics) library
2. Be 1000 lines in length, as dictated by the professor's line checker tool which can be found [here](https://csc1351.cct.lsu.edu/)

**The full project requirements can be found [here](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~sbrandt/csc1351/), aswell as the full course syllabus.**



At the top level, this game in **intended** to be a sandbox-based survival game, however due to time and project constraints (and programming knowledge), 
I was unable to get the sandbox aspect functioning. 
However, it is still a decently fun wave game.

Overall, this project helped me increase my knowledge and experience in video game & object-oriented programming.
